# ISL-to-multilingual-texts
Helpful to the dumb and deaf community of India who uses Indian Sign Language to communicate.
This project is a deep learning-based solution for recognizing Indian Sign Language (ISL) dynamic gestures from video input. It uses a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify gestures and Streamlit to provide a web-based interface. The recognized gesture is also translated into Hindi and Kannada using Google Translate.
